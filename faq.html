      <h1 class="faqh2"> What is a Comprehensive Policy? </h1>
      <p>Health insurance policies have always been looked at as either tax-saving options or as something that requires minimal investment. After all, no one plans to fall sick, right? Very few times have they been viewed as the safety net that
        insurance policies truly are.</p>
      <p>The truth is that with the changing lifestyle where we are demanding more and more of our minds and bodies without being able to take care of ourselves, a health insurance plan becomes an important safety net against stress and
        lifestyle-induced medical problems.</p>
      <p>And if a healthcare policy has to be a safety net, it should ideally provide end-to-end coverage for all planned and unplanned medical expenses. An all-encompassing policy has to cover everything, from hospitalisation expenses to pre-or post
        hospitalisation, or even out-patient consults and daycare treatments. And it doesn’t just end with allopathy; it ideally has to cover alternative therapies like Ayurveda, Unani, Siddha, Homeopathy, etc. Be it treatment for lifestyle-related
        problems like obesity or bariatric surgery, or even organ donation, a medical plan should be able to stand by the insured at all times.</p>
      <p>When a health insurance plan provides such wide coverage, it means it is providing comprehensive health insurance. Let’s look at the Comprehensive Health Insurance Plan by Star Health Insurance and how it’s the right choice for individuals
        and families looking for across-the-board protection.</p>
